# Simple-Generative-Art-with-Python

Generative art is a form of digital art that is created using algorithms and computer code. Instead of being created manually by an artist, generative art is created by a computer program that follows a set of rules and parameters to generate a unique and often unpredictable image or animation.

Generative art can take many different forms, from simple geometric patterns to complex organic shapes and animations. Some generative art programs are designed to mimic the behavior of natural systems, such as fractals or cellular automata, while others are more abstract and based on mathematical or geometric patterns.

One of the key features of generative art is that the artist creates a set of rules or parameters that govern how the artwork is generated, but they do not have direct control over the final output. This can lead to surprising and unexpected results, as the computer program explores the possibilities within the artist's constraints.

Generative art has become increasingly popular in recent years, with artists and programmers creating a wide range of innovative and unique artworks using code and algorithms.
